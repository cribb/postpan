# postpan
Post-processing code for an experiment run in the Panoptes HT microscope.

The sole purpose of this project is to take a stock dataset (path) outputted from PanopticNerve and convert its contents into a single file accessible by python or MATLAB. See 3dfmAnalysis and pypan projects for data analysis.

## Required Packages
- Imagemagick
- PanopticNerve v7.2.1
- Video Spot Tracker v8+

## For now, postpan serves as my learning curve project for github.
